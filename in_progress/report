ABC127E - Cell Distance
    - Solve X and Y separately
    - Fix 2 cells and count how many times it's repeated. (MN-2)C(K-2)
    - Algebra => MN(MN-1)(M+N)/6 * (MN-2)C(K-2)


ABC127F - Absolute Maxima
    - Add up all b's
    - Median of all a's
    - Rolling median
    - A += |a - med| - |med - new_med| 
    - Don't subtract |med-new_med| if both med and new_med are middle 2.
