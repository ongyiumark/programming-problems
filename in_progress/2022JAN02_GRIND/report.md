Solved ABC185E - Sequence matching and ABC184F - Programming contest

For sequence matching, I solved it in ~15 mins. I guessed it was just Levenstein distance and it worked. 

Post-analysis: I guess it makes sense since `x` and `y` represent removing and replacing. And instead of inserting, we can just remove from the other array (which is counted by `x`).


For programming contest, it took me ~90 mins. But the first hour was me trying to make DP work. Then, I eventually abandoned it and found a meet-in-the-middle solution.
