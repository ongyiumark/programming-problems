#
# Testing tool for the Jagged Skyline problem
#
# Usage:
#
#   python3 testing_tool.py -f inputfile <program invocation>
#
#
# Use the -f parameter to specify the input file, e.g. 1.in.
# Format of the input file:
# - One line with two integers, the width and height of the grid.
# - One line with one integer per column: the height of the building in this column.
# e.g.:
# 6 10
# 3 10 0 2 3 1
#
#
# You can compile and run your solution as follows.
# - You may have to replace 'python3' by just 'python'.
# - On Windows, you may have to to replace '/' by '\'.

# C++:
#   g++ solution.cpp
#   python3 testing_tool.py -f 1.in ./a.out

# Java
#   javac solution.java
#   python3 testing_tool.py -f 1.in java solution

# Python3
#   python3 testing_tool.py -f 1.in python3 ./solution.py


# The tool is provided as-is, and you should feel free to make
# whatever alterations or augmentations you like to it.
#
# The tool attempts to detect and report common errors, but it is not an
# exhaustive test. It is not guaranteed that a program that passes this testing
# tool will be accepted.
